One place reminders of how to interact with some of the Strava APIs

# Authenticate

A website would redirect the user to here
http://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID]&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=read
Note the requested Scope is set in the URL above. Set this based on what the APIs you need require
then the result would return back to the callback URL of the website.

curl -X POST \
  https://www.strava.com/oauth/token \
  -F client_id=<from https://www.strava.com/settings/api> \
  -F client_secret=<from https://www.strava.com/settings/api> \
  -F code=<code from response> \
  -F grant_type=authorization_code
  
# Refresh token

curl -X POST \
  https://www.strava.com/oauth/token \
  -F client_id=<from https://www.strava.com/settings/api> \
  -F client_secret=<from https://www.strava.com/settings/api> \
  -F refresh_token=<received from the Authenticate call above> \
  -F grant_type=refresh_token
  
# Get Activities
