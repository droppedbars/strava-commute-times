# strava-commute-times
Test project to try Strava APIs, and some different things

This project is very much in progress and highly iterative. The initial goal is simply to learn to interact with some of the Strava APIs, with the data output being some analysis of commute departure times. It may expand to also work with setting up a simple web service with the login redirects.

Expect a very slow moving project due to minimal free time!

* Phase 1: map out the necessary APIs calls to get the data I want
* Phase 2: implement the calls using Golang, and turn the data into something interesting
* Phase 3: turn phase 2 into APIs
* Phase 4: implement a simple web site to call the APIs and display results
* Phase 5: deal with the authentication redirection from the web site and store the user keys in the backend
