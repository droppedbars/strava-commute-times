# strava-commute-times
Test project to try Strava APIs, and some different things in Go

This project is very much in progress and highly iterative. The initial goal is simply to learn to interact with some of the Strava APIs, with the out being calculations of time spent riding commutes vs pleasure rides. 

Expect a very slow moving project due to minimal free time!

* (X) Phase 1: map out the necessary APIs calls to get the data I want
* (X) Phase 2: implement the calls using Golang, and turn the data into something interesting
Some other possibilities to try:
* Restructure to make use of OOP
* Do visualization of the data
